Around 5% of people online use Web3, which means over 4 billion don't. We found two main reasons why people don't join Web3: they don't understand its value, like owning and trading cryptocurrencies, and they think it's too hard to join because they need to learn about blockchain, and coding skills. To help fix these issues, we created "CryptoFounders."

CryptoFounders is a user-friendly app that lets you create your own cryptocurrency to showcase your unique talents and exchange them with others. With or without a digital wallet, CryptoFounders simplifies making your unique cryptocurrency in a few steps.
